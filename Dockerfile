# Lean BackIssue image for distribution — no browser stack. A normal install
# (reader, opds, usenet/torrent sources, …) never needs Chromium/Xvfb; only a
# plugin that drives a real browser does, and none ship in the public catalog.
# For a browser-enabled deployment, build Dockerfile.browser (adds Chromium +
# Xvfb, ~1GB).
#
# Multi-stage: the build stage (full node image, has the toolchain) resolves
# production dependencies and builds the web UI; the runtime stage is a slim
# image carrying only node_modules, the server, and the built UI. This keeps
# the published image small (~150MB vs ~490MB for a single-stage full-image
# build) so pulls and updates are cheap.

# ---- build: production deps + web UI (needs the full image's compilers) ----

# Runtime deps only. --omit=optional drops patchright (browser automation) —
# the lean image has no Chromium, so it's dead weight here; the browser image
# and local dev keep it. better-sqlite3 compiles here if no prebuilt binary
# matches, then its native binding is copied into the slim runtime below (same
# Debian/glibc + arch, so the .node file is compatible).

# Build the Svelte UI (→ frontend/dist, which the server serves). Drop the
# committed lockfile first: it may have been generated on another OS (e.g.
# Windows), and npm's optional-deps bug then skips this platform's native
# bundler binding (@rolldown/binding-*). See npm/cli#4828.
# .npmrc rides along: it carries legacy-peer-deps, without which a fresh
# resolve can crash in npm 10 (see the note in frontend/.npmrc).
